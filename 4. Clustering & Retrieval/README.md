### Case Study - Finding Similar Documents

In the case study of finding similar documents, similarity-based algorithms for retrieval were examined. Structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were examined. Implemented expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.

### Work done

* Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.
* Identify various similarity metrics for text data.
* Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.
* Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.
* Cluster documents by topic using k-means.
* Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.
* Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).
* Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
* Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.
* Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization

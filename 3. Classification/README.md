### Case Study - Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction

In the case study on Amazon, models were built to predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).

In the case study on lending club, models were built to predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank.

### Work done

* Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
* Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.
* Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
* Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
* Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
* Describe the underlying decision boundaries.
* Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.
* Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
* Use techniques for handling missing data.
* Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
* Implemented these techniques in Python

### Datasets

* Amazon review database consisting 183531 entries
* Lending club data sub-set consisting of 122607 entries
